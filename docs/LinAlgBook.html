A Birds Eye view of linear algebra is a linear algebra textbook that fully leverages the digital medium. It is based on Obsidian. This means the book is:

1) Editable. Unlike static textbooks, this whole book is based on markdown files (flat text rendered beautifully). So, you can edit this book, add notes and personalize it to your hearts content making it truly yours.

2) Multi-modal content: Because of the digital format, it is possible to add dynamic content like moving .GIF images, videos, etc. increasing the arsenal of tools available for truly embedding the content into the readers brain.

3) Indexed and searchable: Because the book is based on Obsidian, it is fully indexed, richly tagged and highly searchable.
